# TripPilot Progress

## Completed

- Project repository created
- Next.js frontend initialized
- FastAPI backend initialized
- Frontend runs locally
- Backend health endpoint runs locally
- Responsive Shanghai 1-3 day trip request form
- Pydantic TripRequest validation and typed TripPlan / DayPlan / Activity response models
- POST /trips/plan returning a fixed Shanghai two-day Mock plan
- Local CORS configuration for localhost:3000 and 127.0.0.1:3000
- Frontend fetch integration with loading, error, success and duplicate-submit protection
- Inline Mock itinerary cards showing destination, estimated cost, days, activities and times
- Backend validation and API tests

## Current

- First full-stack Mock data loop implemented and verified (2026-09-09)
- All valid 1-3 day requests return the same two-day fixture, independent of user preferences
- Cost and activity times are explicitly labeled fictional test values; no real travel data or external services are connected

## Next

- Await the user's next scoped task; no next-stage work started

## Verification (2026-09-09)

- Backend: `cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 7 tests passed, including subcases for required fields, invalid values, supported durations/paces, response shape, CORS and health
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run lint` — passed
- Default `npm run build` — attempted; blocked by Google Fonts network access, then the environment's Turbopack internal port-binding restriction
- `npm run build -- --webpack` — passed, including TypeScript and static page generation
- FastAPI launched successfully on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Live HTTP: GET /health returned 200; POST /trips/plan returned 200 with two days / six activities; a negative budget returned 422; allowed-origin CORS response confirmed
- Production frontend served successfully on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Safari UI: submitted the actual form and displayed the backend's Shanghai two-day plan, Mock cost of CNY 1,000.00, six activities and their times
- Safari UI: whitespace-only accommodation triggered the backend 422 error message; correcting the value and resubmitting displayed the plan again

## Local Run

- Backend: `cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (port 3000)
- If Turbopack is unavailable in the execution environment, use `npm run dev -- --webpack`, or build with `npm run build -- --webpack` and run `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000`
- Browser requests target `http://127.0.0.1:8000/trips/plan`; both services must be running locally

## Known Issues

- Default Turbopack build is blocked by a port-binding permission restriction in the agent environment; webpack build succeeds
- Existing next/font/google setup requires Google Fonts access during a fresh build
- Existing Starlette TestClient emits an httpx deprecation warning; tests pass without changing dependencies
- PROJECT_CONTEXT.md specifies Python 3.12, while backend/pyproject.toml requires Python >=3.13; verification used the existing Python 3.13 environment
